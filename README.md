# SudokuSolver
• Designed an efficient Sudoku solver algorithm using Backtracking and Constraint Propagation techniques  
• Utilized OpenCV for image preprocessing, including Noise Removal, Contour Detection, and Perspective Correction,to accurately extract the digits from input Sudoku image, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of the Sudoku solver  
• Trained a neural network on the MNIST dataset to achieve 98.3% accurate recognition of the extracted digits from the image
